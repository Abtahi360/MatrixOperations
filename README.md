# MatrixOperations
MatrixOperations is a C++ program that performs basic matrix operations such as addition, transpose, and multiplication. The program demonstrates these operations using predefined 3x3 matrices.

# Features
1. Matrix Addition: Computes the sum of two 3x3 matrices.
2. Matrix Transpose: Computes the transpose of a 3x3 matrix.
3. Matrix Multiplication: Computes the product of two 3x3 matrices.

# Functions
1. void sum(int a[3][3], int b[3][3], int i, int j): Adds two matrices and prints the result.
2. void transpose(int a[3][3], int i, int j): Computes the transpose of a matrix and prints the result.
3. void multiplication(int a[3][3], int b[3][3], int i, int k, int j): Multiplies two matrices and prints the result.
